    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Hard Constraints (10 Points Each)\n",
    "• An exam will be scheduled for each course.\n",
    "• A student is enrolled in at least 3 courses. A student cannot give more than 1 exam at a time.\n",
    "• Exam will not be held on weekends.\n",
    "• Each exam must be held between 9 am and 5 pm\n",
    "• Each exam must be invigilated by a teacher. A teacher cannot invigilate two exams at the same time.\n",
    "• A teacher cannot invigilate two exams in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soft Constraints (5 Points Each)\n",
    "• All students and teachers shall be given a break on Friday from 1-2.\n",
    "• A student shall not give more than 1 exam consecutively.\n",
    "• Two hours of break in the week such that at least half the faculty is free in one slot and the rest of the faculty is free in the other slot so the faculty meetings shall be held in parts as they are now.\n",
    "• If a student is enrolled in a MG course and a CS course, it is preferred that their MG course exam be held before their CS course exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Constraints (Mentioned Later on, Points not known)\n",
    "• 28 Students per Class\n",
    "• Use binary encoding for chromosome.\n",
